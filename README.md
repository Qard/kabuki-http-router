# kabuki-http-router

This is not ready yet. It's very much a work in progress. The intent is to be
able to mount a [kabuki](http://npm.im/kabuki) interface as http routes.

How it will ultimately work is as yet unknown. I need to experiment a bit more
with how sessions would work and I'll probably make the routing interface a
little friendlier than individual handler builders at some point...
